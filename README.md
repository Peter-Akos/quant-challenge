# The task
Develop a model to predict crop yield based on weather data in Minnesota for corn, soybeans and oats.

# Our solution

We matched the weather stations to counties, managed to get the techincal improvements over the years out ot the equation by fitting a linear regression on the yearly average yield and trained a LSTM on the yearly weather data to predict the yield.
